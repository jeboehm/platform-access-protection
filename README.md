platform-access-protection
==========================

platform-access-protection is a Shopware 6 plugin allows you to password protect
your Shopware Storefront.
This is useful for staging environments or for shops that are not yet ready to be
visible to the public.

The plugin uses the users from the Shopware Administration to login. It's also possible
to whitelist IP addresses, so that they can access the storefront without a password.

You can restrict which users are allowed to access by specifying one or more user roles.
Admins are always allowed.

Configure the plugin in the plugin settings.

**Platform Access Protection for Shopware 6**

The Platform Access Protection plugin allows you to safeguard your Shopware storefront with
a password, ensuring that only authorized users can access it. This feature is particularly
useful for test environments or online stores that are not yet ready for public visibility.

**How it works**

The plugin seamlessly integrates with your existing Shopware administration panel, leveraging
its user base to authenticate login attempts. Additionally, you can skip the password prompt by
whitelisting specific IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) or subnet prefixes, providing flexibility in
managing access control.

**User Role Restriction**

To fine-tune access control, you can specify one or more user roles that are allowed to access the
storefront. Admins will always have unrestricted access.

Configure the plugin in the plugin settings.

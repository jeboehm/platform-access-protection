<p>Simply install via the Shopware app manager in the shop administration.<br />
Configure the plugin using the plugin settings. All the possible options are explained<br />
there in detail.</p>
<h2 id="ip-whitelisting">IP Whitelisting</h2>
<p>You can configure IP addresses that are always allowed to access the storefront,<br />
without the need to authenticate.<br />
IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. Subnet masks or IPv6 prefixes can also be specified.</p>
<p><em><strong>Be mindful when using a proxy server or load balancer</strong></em><br />
In order for the IP whitelisting to work correctly when using an additional reverse proxy server,<br />
it is necessary to store the IP address of the proxy in the .env configuration file<br />
(in the Shopware main directory) as a trusted proxy. This is possible via the entry<br />
<em>TRUSTED_PROXIES=IP_of_the_proxy</em>.</p>
<p>Alternatively this is also possible using the PHP settings. More information on how<br />
to do this in PHP can be found at <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/deployment/proxies.html#solution-settrustedproxies">https://symfony.com/doc/current/deployment/proxies.html#solution-settrustedproxies</a></p>

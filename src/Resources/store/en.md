This plugin allows you to add password protection to the Shopware storefront.
This is especially useful for test or staging systems that should not (yet) be accessible
to the public.

## Allow users and IP addresses

The users from the Shopware administration are used. It is possible to restrict the users
to certain roles. Furthermore, IP addresses can be configured which are always be able to access.

## Configuration
The configuration is done in the plugin settings.

## Open Source
This plugin can also be downloaded free of charge from https://github.com/jeboehm/platform-access-protection.
Nevertheless, I am happy about a purchase if you like it. Thank you very much!
